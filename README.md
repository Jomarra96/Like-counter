# Problem

I work in automotive. Got the infamous [AUTOSAREEEE](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/leq366/comment/gmiq6d0/) post on a wall at the office, and I want to measure my colleagues' interaction .

# Solution

Get/Create a device that tracks interaction with post. 
Commercial options look ugly AF so wanted to hack something with a little personality.
